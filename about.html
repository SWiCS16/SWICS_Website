									<h2>ABOUT</h2>
									<p>Who We Are</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									&nbsp; <b>Stevens Women in Computer Science (SWiCS) Club </b>aims to unite undergraduate students of all 
									genders, majors, enthinicties and other identities in order to promote women in the 
									computer science related fields obth in academia and industry. 
								<br> 
								<br> 
									&nbsp; Situated at Stevens Institute of Technology - a premiere private research university in 
									Hoboken, NJ, SWiCS flourishes in an environment where 30% of the population is female
									and out of all computer science majors, less than <b>45%</b> are female. 
								<br> 
								<br> 
									&nbsp; Against all odds, SWiCS is the driving force that establishes <b>computer science as a 
										highly desirable career</b> for women through an exciting array of workshops, networking 
									opportunities, and conferences. 
								</p>

										<h3>Purpose</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										&nbsp; The purpose of this club is to bring together students who support the <b>advancement of women in Computer Science </b> in 
										both academia and in industry. We provide support for women pursuing a Computer Science major, and encourage all 
										other students who have interest in Computer Science. We collaborate with other WiCS chapters around the country
										through conferences and networking events to encourage the involvement of women in S.T.E.M and provide career 
										development. Within Stevens and our Hoboken community, we promote programming and technical skills to women
										through campus-wide workshops that introduce computer science topics to beginners as well as continue to 
										improve the skills of advanced computer scientists.
