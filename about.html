We provide support for women pursuing a Computer Science major, and encourage all other students who have interest in Computer Science. We collaborate with other WiCS chapters around the countrythrough conferences and networking events to encourage the involvement of women in S.T.E.M and provide career development. Within Stevens and our Hoboken community, we promote programming and technical skills to womenthrough campus-wide workshops that introduce computer science topics to beginners as well as continue to improve the skills of advanced computer scientists. </p><p></section><section><header><h3>What We've Acheived</h3></header><p><ul> <li> Created a community where women could find <b>like-minded others</b></li><li> Grew to an organization of <b>100+</b> members on our mailing list and 40+ members attending events </li><li> Sponsored students to <b>Grace Hopper Celebration</b>, funding 10 women in 2018 </li><li> Sponsored students to<b>Harvard WECode</b>, funding 12 women in 2017</li> <li> Have roughly <b>10</b> events per semester to provide programming at all levels</li> <li> Offer <b>technical workshops</b> to supplement CS coursework</li><li> Hold <b>Coffee&&Code</b>sessions with <b>BWE Kafe</b>and <b>Jefferson Coffee</b></li></ul></p></section></article></div><section><div class="col-12"><div id="copyright"><ul class="links"><li>&copy; 2016 Stevens Women in Computer Science </li></ul></div></div></section></div><!-- Scripts --><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/browser.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/util.js"></script><script src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
